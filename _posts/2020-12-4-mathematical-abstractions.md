## Introduction  

One night, while laying in bed, reading Pythagoras' biography and beliefs, I realized - holy smokes! Mathematics aren't based on anything but the experimental explanation of the unexplained in nature.  
I had this revelation a couple of months back while thinking about making a calculator from scratch, and while I was thinking about the conductors and other hardware I needed, the question "Yo how the hell does the plus operation actually work?" hit me like a truck. If that question alone raises a weird feeling inside your brain you can already probably get an idea on why I wanted to write this post.


## Official definition of Mathematics

Ok, let's start with the official, wikipedia-provided definition of maths - Mathematics includes the study of such topics as quantity (number theory), structure (algebra), space (geometry), and change (mathematical analysis). **It has no generally accepted definition**. Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of such by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

## Widely accepted definition
**I'm speaking from experience and subjective opinions**  
Stemming from the fact that everyone is obliged to study at least a little of mathematics in school, that being from a very, very young age, people usually think of maths as just either a subject or a given way of solving numbers. It's very rare to see people who actually realize the philosophical significance and meaning of mathematics. Numbers, operators, equations, variables, and every other part of the "mathematical language" is based on abstraction.

## The abstraction in mathematics.
Most people will picture this in their minds while reading the word abstraction in their minds

Or maybe this

But in reality, the abstraction which maths are based on is much wider than just this. As you probably have wondered some time in your life, maths are a weird thing. A weird, sometimes beautiful, sometimes ugly but always really strange thing. Strange because of the fact that it's based on **absolutely nothing.**  
A lot of people have theories, beliefs and conspiracies on how and why maths is so universal and it works, because it does. You have numerous laws within mathematics and other fields of science like physics, geography, chemistry, etc. that actually use mathematical laws. And they work! In all the fields they're used in - you can accurately predict the distance between Earth and Mars in the next year, you can calculate the exact position of anything using coordinates, you can add and subtract chemicals.  
**So how does it work? Is this magic? What are numbers? What is the meaning of life?**
Those are questions that are normal to pop up in your head, and a lot of people will try to answer that, and we will look at a couple of them in this post.  
Starting with...

## Pythagoras
Yeah we're going to talk about that one guy that supposedly discovered that one theorem we all know \[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \] - the length of 2 sides of a right-angled triangle combined equal to the hypotenuse.  
I got surprised when I found out that he had founded a religio-politico-philosophical cult, known as Pythagoreanism.   

Pythagoras in his teachings cultivated mathematics and numbers, engaging in a combination of philosophic theorizing and deductive provable methodology. Numbers were in the Greek world of Pythagoras' days natural numbers â€“ that is positive integers. But unlike their Greek contemporaries, the Pythagorean philosophers represented numbers graphically, not symbolically through letters. Pythagoreans used dots, also known as psiphi (pebbles), to represent numbers in triangles, squares, rectangles and pentagons. This enabled a visual comprehension of mathematics and allowed for a geometrical exploration of numerical relationships. Pythagorean philosophers investigated the relationship of numbers exhaustively. They defined perfect numbers as those that were equal to the sum of all their divisors. For example: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. The theory of odd and even numbers was central to Pythagorean arithmetic. This distinction was for the Pythagorean philosophers direct and visual, as they arranged triangular dots so that the even and odd numbers successively alternate: 2, 4, 6, ... 3, 5, 7, ...

Early-Pythagorean philosophers such as Philolaus and Archytas held the conviction that mathematics could help in addressing important philosophical problems.[34] In Pythagoreanism numbers became related to intangible concepts. The one was related to the intellect and being, the two to thought, the number four was related to justice because 2 * 2 = 4 and equally even. A dominant symbolism was awarded to the number three, Pythagoreans believed that the whole world and all things in it are summed up in this number, because end, middle and beginning give the number of the whole. The triad had for Pythagoreans an ethical dimension, as the goodness of each person was believed to be threefold: prudence, drive and good fortune.  

Pythagoreanism included a lot of questionable practices, through the eyes of a rational human being in the 21st century of course. Practices that are equivalent to modern astrology. I will give you a small segment and a link to learn more about that, because I don't want to talk about it too much.  
`Number: 1; Positive qualities: Initiative, leadership, individuality, courage, executive ability.;  Negative qualities:Selfishness, laziness, aggressiveness, egotism.`

# Others
The German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences". More recently, Marcus du Sautoy has called mathematics "the Queen of Science ... the main driving force behind scientific discovery". The philosopher Karl Popper observed that "most mathematical theories are, like those of physics and biology, hypothetico-deductive: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently." Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience."

Several authors consider that mathematics is not a science because it does not rely on empirical evidence.
Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions. Intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. Experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics. One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created (as in art) or discovered (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics.

#Conclusuion
So tl;dr maths are something based on nothing. Think about that.
